# 🛫 **TicketBookingApp**

TicketBookingApp is a full-stack ticket booking platform designed to provide users with a seamless booking experience. It features secure login, easy booking management, and real-time ticket deals through API integrations. The application is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React with Vite** for the frontend.

## 🚀 **Upcoming Feature: AI-Powered Booking Assistant**

We are actively working on integrating an **LLM (Large Language Model) prompt-based feature** to enhance the user experience and simplify the booking process.

### **🧠 How It Works:**
Users will be able to interact with the app by providing natural language prompts such as:

> _"I want to fly from Vancouver to New York on February 14th at 2 PM. My budget is $1,500, and I prefer business class with standard baggage allowance on XYZ Airlines. It’s urgent, and I need the best possible fare."_

The **AI-powered assistant** will:
- **Analyze the request in real-time** and understand user preferences, constraints, and urgency.
- **Fetch the best available ticket deals** using the **Amadeus API**, ensuring users receive the lowest prices that match their requirements.
- **Provide personalized recommendations** to streamline the ticket booking process.

### **🎯 Why LLM Integration?**
The LLM-powered feature aims to make the ticket booking process faster, more intuitive, and personalized. Instead of navigating through forms and filters, users can simply describe their travel requirements, and the AI assistant will return tailored booking suggestions.

## 💳 **Real-Time Ticket Deals and Payment Processing**
